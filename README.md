# CODSOFT

This repository contains my tasks for CODSOFT internship 

-The first task is about titanic dataset analysis and classification:

Project Description:

In this project, we explore the Titanic dataset and build a machine-learning model to predict passenger survival. The main objectives of this project are:
Data exploration and analysis to understand the dataset.
Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
Building and training a predictive model.
Evaluating the model's performance.
Providing insights and conclusions based on the analysis.


Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on board the Titanic, including features like age, sex, class, and whether or not they survived. You can find the dataset here.





-The second task is about iris dataset analysis and classification:


Project Description:

The iris.ipynb notebook in this repository is designed to accomplish the following objectives:
Load and understand the Iris dataset.
Explore and visualize the dataset to gain insights.
Potentially build and train machine learning models for species classification.
Evaluate the model's performance.



Dataset:

The Iris dataset is a famous dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of three species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) with four features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The dataset is often used for classification tasks. You can find the dataset here.
