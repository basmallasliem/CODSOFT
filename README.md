This repository contains my tasks for CODSOFT internship 

-The first task is about titanic dataset analysis and classification:

Project Description:

In this project, we explore the Titanic dataset and build a machine-learning model to predict passenger survival. The main objectives of this project are:
Data exploration and analysis to understand the dataset.
Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
Building and training a predictive model.
Evaluating the model's performance.
Providing insights and conclusions based on the analysis.


Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on board the Titanic, including features like age, sex, class, and whether or not they survived. You can find the dataset here.





-The second task is about iris dataset analysis and classification:


Project Description:

The iris.ipynb notebook in this repository is designed to accomplish the following objectives:
Load and understand the Iris dataset.
Explore and visualize the dataset to gain insights.
Potentially build and train machine learning models for species classification.
Evaluate the model's performance.



Dataset:

The Iris dataset is a famous dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of three species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) with four features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The dataset is often used for classification tasks. You can find the dataset here.




-The third task is about credit card fraud dataset analysis and classification:


Project description:

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to develop a machine-learning model that can identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers alike, with potentially severe financial consequences. This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, providing enhanced security and peace of mind for credit cardholders.

Dataset:

The project utilizes a dataset containing credit card transaction data.
Features: The dataset includes various features (columns) that describe each credit card transaction. Some of the common features found in such datasets include:
Time, Amount, V1, V2, ..., V28. 
Target Variable: Class.
